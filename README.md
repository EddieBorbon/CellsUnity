# 🧬 3D Cell Viewer

## Overview
**3D Cell Viewer** is an educational Unity project designed to help students visualize and explore different types of cells—animal, plant, bacterial, and fungal—along with their organelles in an immersive 3D environment. This interactive tool enhances learning by providing a detailed, hands-on experience with cell structures, making biology concepts easier to understand.

## 🚀 Features
- **Interactive 3D Models**: Explore high-quality 3D models of animal, plant, bacterial, and fungal cells.
- **Organelles in Detail**: View and interact with various organelles like the nucleus, mitochondria, chloroplasts, and more.
- **Educational Information**: Each organelle comes with detailed descriptions and explanations of its function.
- **Multiple Cell Types**: Switch between different types of cells (animal, plant, bacterial, and fungal) to compare their structures.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface that guides users through the cell models and their components.

## 🧪 Supported Cell Types
1. **Animal Cell**
2. **Plant Cell**
